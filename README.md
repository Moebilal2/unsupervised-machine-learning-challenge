# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge
## Introduction:
 Medical records were used to classify patients of myopia, or nearsightedness by using classification models.
## Solution steps:
- Data was scaled using standardization technique.
- Dimensionality reduction was performed on the data using PCA model and t-sne respectively.
